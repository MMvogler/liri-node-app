## Deployed App
https://mmvogler.github.io/liri-node-app/


## Technologies Used
- Node 
- Axios
- OMDB API 
- Bands in Town API 


## Purpose 
Liri.js can take in four different commands in the command line, with each producing different requested results:
- "concert-this" followed by a band or musician's name will provide Bands in Town's information about relevant concerts coming up.
- "spotify-this-song" followed by a song's title will provide information about the given song from Spotify. 
- "movie-this" followed by the name of the movie will provide imdb information about that specific movie. 


### Additional Goals 
- "do-what-it-says" will pull information from "random.txt" document and perform the necessary request. 
- Use moment.js to stylize the date in "concert-this" results.
